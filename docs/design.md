# dataforge design

The current design, edited in place. Why a decision was made lives in the PR that made it. Only an orchestra-triggered design pass edits this file; other PRs describe their effect on it under "Design impact".

## 1. What this is, and what it is not

dataforge is the shared part of a "data machine": a small multi-agent workshop that builds datasets with coding agents (today Claude Code, the only supported agent). Each dataset lives in its own repo. This repo holds what every dataset repo shares:

- the machine setup that turns a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 machine into a data machine;
- the files every agent on the machine gets (the base `AGENTS.md`; section 5).

Starting agents, carrying messages between them, tracking who owes work and flagging stuck agents belong to Agent Fleet, a separate project. Installing it on a data machine is planned, not built; see section 5.

How a dataset repo works, which dataforge supports but does not enforce:

- Whoever writes a change does not merge it. A separate agent reviews before merge.
- A change to the dataset-level acceptance criteria passes a two-arm regression: the reference sample scores full marks and an empty output fails. Per-item check scripts ship with the data and go through normal review.
- Specs (what to build, what counts as acceptable) are edited only by people.
- Runtime state lives on the machine under `~/scratch/<repo>/` and is never committed: `progress/<job>.log`, an optional `board.md`, and `lessons.md`, where any agent writes suggestions that become PRs.

Not in scope:

- Dataset-specific code and dependencies; they stay in the dataset's repo.
- Provisioning the machine itself (creating it, the network, the first user and SSH key), and every credential: the user places them by hand.
- Logging the machine into model accounts. Model traffic goes through redcoast, an account gateway developed as a separate project; the machine holds no model login.
- Merging PRs, cross-machine messaging, and model or effort policy.

## 2. Parts and how they connect

```text
  data machine
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  machine/bootstrap.sh -> Ansible (machine/playbook.yml)
    installs uv, Docker, zsh, gh, herdr, Claude Code, gateway client

  redcoast GitHub Release  ------>  gateway client (shim `claude` + redcoast-client)

  every `claude` in a pane -> shim -> redcoast-client -> redcoast -> model
```

The setup in `machine/` runs once per machine and again for upgrades. The gateway shim is first on `PATH` in every zsh (invariant 5), so a `claude` started in a shell always goes through it; the setup passes no token.

## 3. Invariants

Each one links to the test that guards it. Test files: [`machine/tests/`](../machine/tests/) (setup in a clean container), [`.github/scripts/`](../.github/scripts/).

1. The setup is idempotent: a second run reports `changed=0`. [`machine/tests/inside.sh`](../machine/tests/inside.sh).
2. Every tool version is pinned in [`machine/versions.yml`](../machine/versions.yml) (Ubuntu archive packages follow the release). [`machine/tests/inside.sh`](../machine/tests/inside.sh): the per-tool version checks.
3. A gateway client download that does not match its pinned sha256 installs nothing, and the installed version stays in use; a failed replacement puts the old copy back. [`machine/tests/inside.sh`](../machine/tests/inside.sh): "tampered download was accepted", "current moved after a failed replacement".
4. The setup merges its Claude Code settings into the existing files and keeps keys it does not own, including the gateway's auth and proxy settings. [`machine/tests/inside.sh`](../machine/tests/inside.sh): "an existing setting was dropped".
5. The gateway shim is first on `PATH` in every zsh, interactive or not. [`machine/tests/inside.sh`](../machine/tests/inside.sh): "in a non-interactive zsh, claude is …, not the shim".
6. This file has at most 200 lines. [`design-length.test.sh`](../.github/scripts/design-length.test.sh).

## 4. Interfaces

- Setting up a data machine: [`machine/README.md`](../machine/README.md); settings in [`machine/playbook.yml`](../machine/playbook.yml), versions in [`machine/versions.yml`](../machine/versions.yml).

## 5. Known issues and next steps

- No real data machine exists yet. Waiting on: the GitHub account the data machine commits and opens PRs with (a dedicated bot account is recommended), authorized per dataset repo; the gateway machine credential and that account's token, placed by the user. Then check on that machine what no test covers: the `gh` login and the gateway client release download.
- Planned, not built: the agent runtime on a data machine is Agent Fleet. Open questions: how the setup installs it, and how its pinned version is tracked in `machine/versions.yml`.
- The base `AGENTS.md` for data machines is not written yet; the setup installs `machine/agent/AGENTS.md` once it exists.
- The personal zsh layer is a cleaned copy of the user's own configuration and can drift from it.
- Claude Code is the only supported agent. Supporting others needs changes in the setup and in the agent runtime.
